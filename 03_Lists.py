# spam = [['cat', 'bat'], [10,20,30]]

# ['cat', 'bat']
# cat

# 30
# It will give error due to out of range

# Iterating from end of the list

# print(ls[-1]) # 4

# Getting sublist and slices

# spam[2] : is a list with an index
# spam[1:4] : is a list with a slice (two integers)

# In slice first int is where the slice will start and the second integer is where the slice will end

# spam = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
# print(spam[0:2])
# print(spam[0:-2])
#
# ['a', 'b']
# ['a', 'b']

# As a shortcut we can also leave one param like:
# spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat', 'elephant']
# print(spam[:2])
# # ['cat', 'dog']
# print(spam[1:])
# # ['dog', 'bat', 'elephant']
